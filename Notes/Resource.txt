run the code in VSC - python version 3.9.6.64
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Softwares to be downloaded along with links for download :

Latest version of Python - https://www.python.org/
Anaconda - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Steps to be followed to set up first project:
1) Install extension ‘Python’ in Visual Studio Code (VSC) to run the code in
VSC itself
2) ‘pgzero’ module needs to be installed separately. 
3) Please go to Command Prompt (on a Windows machine) or Terminal (on a Macbook) and type ‘pip install pygame’. Once pygame is installed please type ‘pip install pgzero’.
4) Ensure Repl.it Username and Password access.
5) Copy entire code after coding on VSC to a repl. Use template ‘pygame’ for the Repl. Use the link generated to keep track of the projects.

In case VSC does not work on your learner’s machine, your learner can use Repl.it with the template ‘pygame’.
